SYS_B164 ported and recompiled by gcc 9.2.1
the repo is here https://github.com/Turro75/DSO203_SYS164_GCC

branch master produces SYSGCC which is the standard SYS_B164 master

branch insertAlterbios produces SYSGCCA which is the standard SYS_B164 patched by alterbios for use with Quadpawn.

Please note it requires QUADPAWN 0.12 (available in this repo.

Tested on DSO203 HW2.72 (8MB) and DSO203 HW2.82.

Only gcc 9.2.1 toolchain has been able to compile a working binary even on Windows. May be in the future I'll try to understand why.
