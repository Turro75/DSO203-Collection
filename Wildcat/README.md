I found on an old drive several versions of Wildcat's firmware, I like keep them available to see how this wonderful firmware arise.

I added the Wildcat5.7 which You probably won't see in the Motomaxis repo.

The wildcat 5.7 is mainly a bugfix for use on 8Mb devices (like the mine), it works together to Alterbios 0.5 so no FAT corruptions anymore, no need anymore to prepare in advance the CFG files.
