I found on an old drive several versions of Wildcat's firmware, I like keep them available to see how this wonderful firmware arise.

I added the Wildcat5.7 which You probably won't see in the Motomaxis repo.

The wildcat 5.7 is mainly a bugfix for use on 8Mb devices (like the mine), it works together to Alterbios 0.5 so no FAT corruptions anymore, no need anymore to prepare in advance the CFG files.

Wildcat 6.5b is the same fix as 5.7. tested on HW2.82
It is suggested to use it with SYSGCCA, check the SYS folder
